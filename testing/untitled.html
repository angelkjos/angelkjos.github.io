One of the upsides of this monastic routine is a renewed emphasis on breakfast. For years, the day’s &nbsp;first meal was an annoyance, a utilitarian function, mostly involving shoving fistfuls of dry fruit down my throat while pulling myself together for work. These days there’s plenty of time to whip up French toast, spicy potato toasties and filter coffee – all with my kid tugging happily at my knee. As a result, I’m eating less at lunch and significantly less at dinner – not a wholly unsatisfactory outcome.</p><p>Life wasn’t always as healthy. As a college student in America, I was rarely up before 10. And if any undergrad tells you they are, they’re lying. Yet some of my favourite memories of those wonder years involve raging till dawn – then heading with friends to George Webb, a sleepy diner on the outskirts of our Midwestern college town, wolfing down Denver omelettes, grits and sausage links with truckers, winos, piss artists and sundry oddballs.</p><p>Mornings are a little more predictable these days. On weekends my wife, daughter and I head out early to our favourite spots. This is the best time of day to venture out in Mumbai : the roads are desolate, the city just stirring to life. The only diners at this hour are parents and kids, wolfing down akuri, eggs Benedict and buttermilk pancakes, all looking bleary-eyed and dishevelled. No one seems to mind. This is a completely different universe from the Sunday brunch scene – where appearances matter and everyone’s trying to look cool. But few groups match parents in spending power – an opportunity canny restaurateurs have sensed, and responded to by substantially upping their morning game. Where’s all the action taking place? We’ve put together a list of our favourite breakfast venues for this issue. And if you ever catch me at one of them looking like I just rolled out of bed, chances are that I did.</p></div><div class="al-item-credit al-item"><p>CHE KURRIEN <br><em>Editor </em></p></div><div class="al-item-copyright al-item"><p>PHOTO:ARJUN MARK (CHE)</p></div></div></article></div></body></html>
